Code Description
The provided code is a Python script that demonstrates how to retrieve data from a MySQL database and perform various operations using the pandas and SQLAlchemy libraries. It establishes a connection to the MySQL database and fetches data from different tables within the database.

The code performs the following operations:

Imports the necessary libraries, including pandas, SQLAlchemy, streamlit, and plotly.express.
Creates a connection to the MySQL database using SQLAlchemy's create_engine function and the appropriate connection string.
Executes SQL queries to retrieve data from multiple tables in the database, such as agg_trans, agg_user, map_trans, map_user, top_trans, and top_user.
Uses the pd.read_sql function to fetch the query results into pandas DataFrames.
Processes and analyzes the retrieved data using pandas and other libraries.
The rest of the code, not shown here, likely performs additional operations or analysis on the retrieved data, such as visualization using plotly.express.
To use this code:

Install the required packages by running pip install pandas sqlalchemy streamlit plotly.
Update the connection string in the code (mysql+mysqlconnector://root:18BEme035$@localhost/myfirstproject) to match your MySQL database credentials and schema.
Ensure that the table names and columns specified in the SQL queries are correct for your database schema.
Execute the script and observe the results.
Please note that the code assumes you have a working MySQL database and the necessary tables with the appropriate data.

Feel free to modify the description as per your requirements and include any additional details you think would be helpful for users of your code.
